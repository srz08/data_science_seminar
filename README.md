# Description

Those homeworks were part of Data Science Seminar class at Northwestern University (MSAI 339). 
- The first homework targets joining data from multiple sources, accessing data through an API, manipulating data in pandas, and creating analytic reports in pandas.
- The second homework targets a classification problem were the goal is to improve the performance of a base classifier by doing EDA, feature engineering while also checking for data leakage.
- The third homework targets the use of PySpark on MLFlow, by doing classification on a dataset of a million(s) rows. The HW included doing EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and finally creating a data pipeline that also includes hyperparameter optimization.
- The fourth homework targets the use of GPT-2 and the "Weights and Biases" platform to retrain the transformer model on new data, doing inference on a test dataset, and evaluating the model using BLEU score.
